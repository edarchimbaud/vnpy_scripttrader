## Description

ScriptTrader is a functional module for trading script execution. The biggest difference between ScriptTrader and other strategy modules is that it is based on [time-driven] [synchronization logic], and it also supports trading operations in the form of REPL commands in the command line (Jupyter Notebook), and the module does not have backtesting capabilities.
